# Improve asset related disturbances RCA process with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea of the project is to improve root cause analysis of machine or asset related disturbances in a steel plant by utilizing natural language processing for maintenance records. 


## Background

Currently we have lots of structured data in maintenance management system but the utilization is not very good because we are lacking systematic evaluation of failure and repair data. Often it is still quite hard to go through all the maintenance records in order to have a holistic view over the whole plant of what are the dominant failure types and modes (hydraulics, lubrication, bearing faults etc.). By knowing this better we could improve the efficiency of out maintenance processes and thus improce the reliability of the production process. In modern asset management software every machine failure and their respective repair report is recorded in a database. Natural language processing algorithms would be utilized to have a holistic view on the most common failure types and mechanisms.


## How is it used?

We could use natural language processing to categorize the failure and repair data and find out the most common and dominating failure types and mechanisms based on written failure notifications and repair reports. This information would be very beneficial to reliability engineers and maintenance developers.


## Data sources and AI methods

Needed data would be extracted from the maintenance information system database in text format. Natural language processing algorithms will be then implemented to process the data.

## Challenges

Some challenges may be related to how can we point out "relevant" keywords from the data that has been quite freely recorded by humans.

## What next?

This kind of AI system would be built into modern maintenance management software.
